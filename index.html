            <p class="article-text">
              Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship with others and
              it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance everything out.

            <p class="article-text">
              A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or they go overboard
              and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where you want
              it to and make things pop like never before.
