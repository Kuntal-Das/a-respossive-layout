            <p class="abtme-text">
                <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>.
                I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
                appreciate any of it because there was too much.
            </p>
            <p class="abtme-text">
                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
                want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>
            <h3 class="abtme-subheading">How I turned things around</h3>
            <p class="abtme-text">
                <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally
                put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment,
                and I quit my job.
            </p>
            <p class="abtme-text">
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what
                else to do. And it worked.
            </p>
            <h3 class="abtme-subheading">Now I live the simple life </h3>
            <p class="abtme-text">
                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.I'm less stressed, enjoy life
                and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
            </p>
            <p class="abtme-text">
                With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how
                    I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I
                started this site!
